STAT-S 610 - Final Project 
Author: Luis Navarro 
Mail: lunvarr@iu.edu 


This project is composed by 3 main R scripts: 

Functions: contains all the user-written functions to perform the stepwise regression algorithm applied to the matched difference-in-differences model. 
DID: contains the code to implement the simulation study that provides an implementation of the algorithm.
Tests: provides some tests on the functions at the Functions script that verify they are working as they should. 


This project was done as part of my grade for STAT-S 610 by Dr. Julia Fukuyama. 
Great class!! Check the class materials here: https://jfukuyama.github.io/


Of course, all errors are my own and feedback is welcome.
